# Fix the Broken Clock - a Codespace workshop

<img width="846" alt="Analog clock with a blue green gradient background" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22990146/185155017-440cf21d-1104-475a-bad3-5a65f75e0318.png">

## What is this?
This is a workshop used to introduce folks to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program purposely has the following errors: 
- There is a question mark on the clock where the number 6 should render
- The hour hand clock is moving too fast!

In this workshop, participants are challenged to resolve and fix these issues. The following extensions create a self-guided experience for attendees: 
- CodeSwing
- CodeTour

This is made to show the value of running a workshop in Codespaces.
